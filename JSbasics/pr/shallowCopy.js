//A shallow copy of an object is a copy whose properties share the same references (point to the same underlying values) as those of 
//the source object from which the copy was made. As a result, when you change either the source or the copy, you may also cause the other object to change too.

//The term "shallow copy" refers to the process of creating a new object or array and populating it with references to the same elements or values as the original object or array. In the context of the slice() method in JavaScript, when it's used on an array, it creates a shallow copy of a portion of that array.

//In a shallow copy:

//Primitive Values: If the array contains primitive values (like numbers or strings), the shallow copy creates new instances of those primitive values. Changing these values in the original array won't affect the values in the copied array, and vice versa.

///References to Objects: If the array contains objects or arrays (non-primitive values), the shallow copy creates new references to those objects or arrays. However, these references point to the same objects or arrays as in the original array. Therefore, while the copied array is new, the objects or arrays it references are the same as those in the original array. Changes made to the properties of these objects or arrays in either the original or copied array will be reflected in both, as they refer to the same underlying objects.

//Consider an example:


const originalArray = [{ name: 'John' }, { name: 'Alice' }, { name: 'Bob' }];
const shallowCopy = originalArray.slice();

shallowCopy[0].name = 'Sarah';

console.log(originalArray); // Output: [{ name: 'Sarah' }, { name: 'Alice' }, { name: 'Bob' }]
console.log(shallowCopy); // Output: [{ name: 'Sarah' }, { name: 'Alice' }, { name: 'Bob' }]
//In this example, slice() creates a shallow copy of originalArray. When the name of the first object in shallowCopy is changed to 'Sarah', it also affects the same object in the originalArray. This demonstrates that although a new array is created, the objects within both arrays are still references to the same underlying objects.

//Therefore, it's important to note that while slice() creates a new array, it doesnâ€™t deeply clone or copy nested objects within the array. If a deep copy is needed (wherein nested objects are also cloned), additional methods or functions would be required to achieve that, as a shallow copy won't suffice.
